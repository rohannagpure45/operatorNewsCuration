      "executive_summary": "OpenAI has introduced FrontierScience, a new benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level scientific reasoning in AI models across the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. Developed in collaboration with PhD scientists and International Olympiad medalists, the benchmark features two distinct tracks: an 'Olympiad' set for constrained, high-level reasoning and a 'Research' set for multi-step, open-ended scientific tasks. Initial testing shows that while frontier models like GPT-5.2 are beginning to master structured scientific problems, significant challenges remain in performing open-ended research, highlighting both the progress and the current limitations of AI in accelerating scientific discovery.",
      "key_points": [
        "FrontierScience provides a more rigorous evaluation than previous benchmarks like GPQA, which have become saturated as models improve.",
        "The benchmark includes over 700 questions, with a 'gold set' of 160 questions being open-sourced to the community.",
        "The 'Olympiad' track focuses on theoretical, short-answer questions, while the 'Research' track uses a 10-point rubric to grade complex, multi-step subtasks.",
        "GPT-5.2 currently leads performance on the benchmark, scoring 77% on Olympiad tasks and 25% on Research tasks.",
        "Evaluation results indicate that while AI can significantly shorten scientific workflows, human judgment remains essential for problem framing and validation.",
        "The benchmark aims to serve as a 'north star' for developing AI models that can eventually contribute to novel scientific discoveries."
