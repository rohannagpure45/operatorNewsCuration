## Evaluating AI's ability to perform scientific research tasks

- FrontierScience was developed to measure expert-level scientific capabilities that go beyond simple fact recall to include hypothesis generation and synthesis.
- The benchmark consists of two tracks: FrontierScience-Olympiad (100 questions) and FrontierScience-Research (60 subtasks).
- GPT-5.2 is currently the top-performing model, scoring 77% on the Olympiad track and 25% on the Research track.
- The evaluation content was created in collaboration with 42 international Olympiad medalists and 45 PhD-level scientists.

<!--
Speaker Notes:
OpenAI has introduced FrontierScience, a new benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level scientific reasoning in AI models across the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. The benchmark addresses the limitations of existing, saturated evaluations by featuring two distinct tracks: an Olympiad track for constrained reasoning and a Research track for open-ended, PhD-level tasks. Initial evaluations show that while frontier models like GPT-5.2 are making significant strides-outperforming predecessors and competitors-there remains substantial room for improvement in open-ended research tasks, where models currently serve as accelerators for human-led workflows rather than independent discoverers.

## ARC Prize 2025 Results and Analysis

- Team NVARC won the 2025 Kaggle competition with a 24% score on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set.
- Refinement loops, which iteratively optimize programs based on feedback, have become the primary driver of AGI progress in 2025.
- Commercial frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro are now being benchmarked on ARC-AGI by all major AI labs including OpenAI and Anthropic.
- Small-scale models, such as the 7M parameter Tiny Recursive Model, are demonstrating high reasoning efficiency compared to massive LLMs.

**Source:** [ARC Prize](https://arcprize.org/blog/arc-prize-2025-results-analysis) | **Sentiment:** Positive outlook

<!--
Speaker Notes:
The ARC Prize 2025 results highlight significant progress in AI reasoning, driven by the emergence of 'refinement loops' and iterative optimization techniques. While the Grand Prize remains unclaimed, the competition saw a new state-of-the-art score of 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private dataset by team NVARC, and commercial models like Gemini 3 Pro reached 54% through bespoke refinement solutions. The analysis suggests that while AI reasoning systems are evolving rapidly, current benchmarks are facing new challenges from model knowledge 'overfitting,' prompting the upcoming 2026 release of ARC-AGI-3, which will shift focus toward interactive reasoning and action efficiency.

## Crypto's real threat to banks

- The crypto industry has historically faced snootiness and derision from Wall Street's elite circles.
- Crypto is currently supplanting Wall Street's privileged political position, particularly within the American right.
- The industry uses the apocryphal 'ignore-laugh-fight-win' mantra to characterize its rise to power.
- Digital pioneers are now described as being 'mightier than ever' compared to their previous status.

<!--
Speaker Notes:
The crypto industry is transitioning from a marginalized sector mocked by traditional financial elites into a powerful force that threatens Wall Street's long-standing political dominance. By gaining significant influence within the American right, digital pioneers are beginning to supplant the privileged position traditionally held by major banks. This shift marks a critical turning point where the industry is no longer being ignored or fought, but is instead achieving a state of unprecedented strength and relevance in the American power structure.

## AI layoffs in 2025 crossed 50,000: 4 biggest technology companies that called out AI in their job cuts announcement and how - The Times of India

- Data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that 54,883 job cuts in 2025 were directly attributed to AI.
- A Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study suggests AI can automate 11.7% of U.S. jobs, particularly in finance and healthcare.
- Amazon reduced its corporate workforce by 14,000, aiming for a leaner structure to innovate faster using AI.
- Microsoft has integrated AI usage into employee performance reviews, declaring the technology core to every role.

<!--
Speaker Notes:
In 2025, AI-related layoffs in the United States surpassed 50,000, as major technology firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and IBM cited artificial intelligence as a primary driver for organizational restructuring. While companies leverage AI to improve profitability and efficiency-potentially saving $1.2 trillion in wages according to MIT-some experts argue the technology is being used as a justification for downsizing after pandemic-era overhiring. The shift is not only reducing headcount in areas like customer support and HR but also fundamentally changing performance evaluations, with some firms making AI adoption a mandatory metric for employees.
