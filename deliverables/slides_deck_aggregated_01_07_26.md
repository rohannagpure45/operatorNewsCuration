Speaker Notes:
Google has expanded its Gemini 3 model family with the release of Gemini 3 Flash, a high-speed, cost-effective model designed to provide frontier-level intelligence. Combining Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, the model achieves significant performance milestones, including a 90.4% score on the GPQA Diamond benchmark and a 78% score on SWE-bench Verified. Gemini 3 Flash is being integrated across Google's ecosystem, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash as the default model in the Gemini app and AI Mode in Search, while offering developers a 3x speed increase over previous versions at a fraction of the cost. | Gemini 3 Flash Preview (High) has demonstrated strong performance on the ARC-AGI semi-private evaluation benchmarks. The model achieved an accuracy of 84.7% on ARC-AGI-1 and 33.6% on ARC-AGI-2, while maintaining significantly lower operational costs compared to other frontier models. These results highlight a shift toward more cost-effective reasoning capabilities in large language models. | Logan Kilpatrick has announced the launch of Gemini 3 Flash, a new frontier intelligence model designed for high-performance tasks. The model is specifically optimized for coding and tool calling, with performance metrics exceeding those of the previous 2.5 Pro model. It is now available at scale via API with a highly competitive pricing structure of $0.50 per million input tokens and $3.00 per million output tokens. | Google Cloud has launched Gemini 3 Flash, a high-performance AI model designed to provide frontier intelligence at high speeds and low costs for enterprise applications. It bridges the gap between complex reasoning and real-time responsiveness, supporting multimodal processing, agentic coding, and automated workflows. Early enterprise partners, including Box and Salesforce, report significant performance gains, such as a 15% accuracy improvement in data extraction and a 10% boost in coding task efficiency compared to previous iterations.

<!--
Speaker Notes:
OpenAI has introduced FrontierScience, a new benchmark designed to evaluate AI's expert-level scientific reasoning across physics, chemistry, and biology. This benchmark addresses the limitations of existing datasets like GPQA, which have become saturated as models like GPT-5.2 reach high levels of performance. FrontierScience consists of two distinct tracks: an 'Olympiad' track for constrained reasoning and a 'Research' track for multi-step, open-ended scientific tasks, providing a more rigorous assessment of how AI can accelerate real-world scientific workflows.
