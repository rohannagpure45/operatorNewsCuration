## NVIDIA Team Wins ARC Prize 2025 as AI Reasoning Shifts To...

- Team NVARC, composed of NVIDIA Kaggle Grandmasters, won the 2025 competition using a fine-tuned compact model rather than a massive computing system.
- The winning approach achieved a 24% score on the ARC-AGI-2 private set by leveraging synthetic data generation and adaptive reinforcement learning.
- Refinement loops-which iteratively optimize programs based on feedback-have emerged as the primary driver of AGI reasoning progress in 2025.
- Commercial models are showing high performance, with Gemini 3 Pro reaching 54% on ARC-AGI through specialized refinement techniques.
- Small-scale models, such as a 7M parameter Tiny Recursive Model, are demonstrating that high reasoning efficiency can be achieved without massive LLM architectures.

## Nvidia Secures $20 Billion Strategic Talent and Technolog...

- Nvidia is paying $20 billion for a non-exclusive license to Groq's inference technology and the strategic hiring of its top leadership.
- Groq founder Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra will join Nvidia, while Simon Edwards takes over as Groq's CEO to maintain the startup's independent operations.
- The deal is a 'talent and tech grab' designed to secure specialized IP while avoiding the regulatory hurdles of a full merger.
- Groq's LPU technology reportedly runs Large Language Models up to 10x more energy-efficiently than standard GPUs, addressing a critical bottleneck in AI deployment.
- The move serves as a defensive response to 'Google fear,' following reports that Meta was exploring Google's TPUs, which previously caused a $250 billion dip in Nvidia's market value.
