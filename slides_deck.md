## Nvidia's Reported $20B Groq Asset Acquisition

- $20B reported transaction—Nvidia's largest deal to date
- Integrates Groq's low-latency SRAM-based processors into AI factory
- Structured as licensing agreement and talent acquisition
- Groq founder Jonathan Ross transitions to Nvidia; GroqCloud remains independent

<!--
Speaker Notes:
*Reconciled from multiple sources—details should be verified against primary announcements.*

Multiple sources report Nvidia has executed a $20 billion acquisition of assets from AI chip startup Groq, marking the company's largest transaction to date (nearly tripling its previous record). The deal is structured as a non-exclusive licensing agreement and talent acquisition, which sources suggest may help navigate regulatory scrutiny.

Key personnel: Groq founder Jonathan Ross and key engineers are reported to transition to Nvidia. Ross's exact role varies across sources (described as joining "engineering team" or "leadership team").

Groq independence: GroqCloud, Groq's inference cloud business, is reported to remain independent under new leadership, separate from the acquisition.

Technology: The acquisition brings Groq's specialized SRAM-based, low-latency Language Processing Units (LPUs)—reported to be up to 10x more energy-efficient than DRAM-based alternatives—into Nvidia's 'AI factory' architecture for real-time inference workloads.

Strategic context: Industry analysts view this as a defensive move to prevent hyperscale competitors from acquiring Groq's IP while securing sovereign AI partnerships.

## Meta Unveils Mango and Avocado AI Models

- Launch scheduled for first half of 2026
- Mango: High-fidelity video with physics-based 'world models'
- Avocado: Advanced code synthesis and agentic reasoning
- Strategic shift to proprietary, closed-source model development

**Source:** [Voxfor](https://www.voxfor.com/meta-unveils-mango-and-avocado-a-new-generation-of-ai-models-to-reset-competitive)

<!--
Speaker Notes:
Meta Platforms has announced a strategic pivot to regain AI leadership by developing two proprietary models, "Mango" and "Avocado," slated for release in the first half of 2026. Mango is designed for high-fidelity video generation using "world models" that simulate physical laws, while Avocado focuses on advanced code synthesis and agentic reasoning. This initiative marks a significant departure from Meta's historical open-source strategy and follows a major reorganization under Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), led by Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang. Despite these ambitions, the company faces internal challenges, including talent retention issues and the need to close the gap with competitors like OpenAI and Google.
