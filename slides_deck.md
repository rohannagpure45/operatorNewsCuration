## After Gobbling Up DRAM, NVIDIA & SK hynix Plan to Introduce an “AI SSD” With 10× Higher Performance, Ringing Alarms Over NAND Supply

- NVIDIA and SK hynix are collaborating on 'Storage Next' for AI inference.
- The AI SSD aims for 100 million IOPS, 10x higher than enterprise SSDs.
- A prototype is expected by late 2026 with a 2027 launch goal.
- The solution serves as a pseudo-memory layer for massive model parameters.

**Source:** [Wccftech](https://wccftech.com/after-gobbling-up-dram-nvidia-sk-hynix-plan-to-introduce-an-ai-ssd) | **Sentiment:** Mixed perspectives

<!--
Speaker Notes:
NVIDIA and SK hynix are reportedly co-developing a specialized 'AI SSD' under the internal project name 'Storage Next,' aimed at revolutionizing inference workloads. This new storage solution is designed to deliver up to 100 million IOPS, providing a high-throughput pseudo-memory layer for massive AI model parameters that exceed the capacity of HBM and DRAM. While the technology promises a 10x performance leap and significant efficiency gains, it has sparked concerns regarding the stability of the NAND flash supply chain, potentially mirroring the price volatility currently seen in the DRAM market.
